  <h1>5 Things Ruining Your Sleep That Have Nothing to Do with Screen Time</h1>

  <div class="article-body">
    <p>The first thing anyone says when you mention bad sleep: "Try putting your phone down an hour before bed." And yes, blue light can affect melatonin production. That is real.</p>

    <p>But if you are still sleeping badly after doing that, the problem is probably not your screen. It is your bedroom. Specifically, these five things.</p>

    <h2>1. Noise You Do Not Remember Hearing</h2>

    <p>Your brain processes sound even while you sleep. A noise does not have to fully wake you up to disrupt your sleep cycle. Sounds as low as <span class="stat">40 dB</span> (about the volume of a quiet conversation) can pull you from deep sleep into lighter sleep without you ever realizing it.</p>

    <p>Common offenders: HVAC systems cycling on and off, a partner snoring, traffic outside, a dog barking down the street, plumbing sounds, garbage trucks. You may not remember any of these in the morning, but your sleep data tells the story. A noise event at 2 AM followed by 90 minutes of restless sleep is not a coincidence.</p>

    <h2>2. Room Temperature</h2>

    <p>The ideal sleep temperature for most adults is between <span class="stat">60-67°F (15-19°C)</span>. Most people sleep in rooms that are too warm. Your body needs to drop its core temperature by about 2-3 degrees to initiate and maintain sleep. If your room is 74°F, your body is fighting physics.</p>

    <p>The tricky part is that room temperature changes throughout the night. Your heater cycles off at midnight. The sun starts warming the room at 5 AM. A partner's body heat raises the temperature under the covers. These shifts are invisible unless something is tracking them.</p>

    <h2>3. Humidity</h2>

    <p>This one surprises people. Humidity between <span class="stat">30-50%</span> is ideal for sleep. Below 30%, your airways dry out, which can lead to snoring, dry mouth, and restless sleep. Above 50%, the air feels heavy, sweat does not evaporate efficiently, and your body has trouble cooling down.</p>

    <p>If you live in a climate with seasons, your indoor humidity swings dramatically between winter (often below 20% with heating) and summer (often above 60% without dehumidification). Most people never measure it.</p>

    <h2>4. Inconsistent Noise, Not Just Loud Noise</h2>

    <p>Constant noise is less disruptive than inconsistent noise. A fan running all night at 45 dB is far less damaging to sleep than a room that alternates between silence and 45 dB. Your brain reacts to <span class="highlight">changes</span> in sound level, not just the sound itself.</p>

    <p>This is why white noise machines work. They do not make the room quieter. They make the room more consistent. They fill in the gaps so that when a car passes outside, the relative change in volume is smaller and your brain is less likely to respond.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Own Snoring</h2>

    <p>About <span class="stat">45%</span> of adults snore at least occasionally. Most of them have no idea how often or how loudly. Snoring can fragment your own sleep even if it does not fully wake you. It is also one of the early indicators of sleep apnea, which is seriously underdiagnosed.</p>

    <p>If you sleep alone, you have no way of knowing you snore unless something is listening. Most people find out from a partner. But if you do not have a partner in the room, you could be snoring for years without any awareness.</p>

    <h2>What You Can Actually Do</h2>

    <p>The first step is measuring. You cannot fix what you cannot see. That is the whole idea behind DriftLab. It monitors your sleep environment overnight and shows you exactly what happened: every noise event, every temperature shift, every snoring episode. Timestamped and correlated.</p>

    <p>Once you see the data, the fixes are usually simple. A white noise machine. A fan. Adjusting the thermostat schedule. A humidifier in winter. Earplugs. Changing your sleep position. DriftLab's Labs feature lets you test each change and measure the before-and-after, so you are not guessing.</p>

    <p>Put your phone down before bed if you want. But also look at what is happening in the room after you close your eyes. That is where the real answers are.</p>
