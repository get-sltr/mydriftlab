By using MyDriftLAB, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.</p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <p><strong>The short version:</strong> MyDriftLAB never records, stores, or transmits raw audio. All audio processing happens on your device. We never sell your data. HealthKit data is never used for advertising. You control everything.</p>

    <h3 class="sub-title">1.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <p>(a) Audio Metering Data: ambient noise levels measured in decibels (dB), noise event timestamps, event duration, event severity, and detection confidence scores. NO raw audio is collected, stored, or transmitted. All audio processing occurs on your device.</p>
    <p>(b) Sensor Data: ambient light levels (Android only), accelerometer readings for motion detection, barometric pressure readings.</p>
    <p>(c) Device Information: device type, operating system version, app version, timezone, and general device identifiers necessary for service operation.</p>
    <p>(d) Usage Data: app interaction patterns, feature usage, session start and end times, content played, and content completion rates.</p>

    <h3 class="sub-title">1.3 Apple HealthKit Data (Optional)</h3>
    <p>If you choose to enable Apple HealthKit integration, MyDriftLAB may access the following data types with your explicit per-type permission:</p>
    <p>(a) Heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV)</p>
    <p>(b) Blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)</p>
    <p>(c) Skin temperature (wrist temperature deviation from baseline)</p>
    <p>(d) Respiratory rate</p>
    <p>(e) Sleep analysis data (sleep stages: awake, REM, core, deep)</p>
    <p>(f) Wrist motion and movement data</p>
    <p>(g) Sleep apnea events and hypertension alerts (where available on device)</p>
    <p>(h) Additional health data types as they become available through Apple HealthKit, subject to your explicit approval</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>HealthKit data is NEVER used for advertising, marketing, or data mining purposes.</strong> This data is used exclusively to provide you with sleep insights and environment-to-body correlation analysis.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="sub-title">1.4 Estimated Environmental Data</h3>
    <p>(a) Estimated Temperature: derived from device barometer sensor and/or user-provided thermostat settings. Clearly labeled as "Estimated" in the App.</p>
    <p>(b) Estimated Humidity: derived from local weather API data for your general geographic area. Clearly labeled as "Estimated" in the App.</p>
    <p>These estimates are approximations and may not reflect actual room conditions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <p>(a) Provide, maintain, and improve the Service, including generating sleep reports, Rest Scores, trends, patterns, and personalized recommendations.</p>
    <p>(b) Correlate environment events (noise, light, motion) with body metrics (heart rate, sleep stages) when HealthKit data is available, to provide cause-and-effect sleep insights.</p>
    <p>(c) Personalize your experience, including recommending wind-down routines based on your historical sleep data.</p>
    <p>(d) Process subscription payments and manage your account.</p>
    <p>(e) Send you service-related communications, including updates, security alerts, and support messages.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p><strong>3.1 Audio Data.</strong> MyDriftLAB processes audio exclusively on your device. Raw audio is never stored, transmitted, or accessible to SLTR Digital LLC or any third party. Only derived numeric data (dB levels, timestamps, event metadata) leaves your device.</p>
    <p><strong>3.2 HealthKit Data.</strong> HealthKit data is read locally on your device. Derived insights (correlations, summaries) may be transmitted to our servers for storage and trend analysis. Raw HealthKit samples are not transmitted unless necessary to provide the Service, and are always encrypted in transit.</p>
    <p><strong>3.3 Infrastructure.</strong> We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) for our backend infrastructure. Data is encrypted at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3. Access to production databases is restricted through Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configurations, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, and Cognito-based authentication.</p>
    <p><strong>3.4 Data Retention.</strong> We retain your personal data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service. Sleep session data, environment events, and derived insights are retained for the duration of your account. Upon account deletion, we will delete or anonymize your personal data within thirty (30) days, except where retention is required by law.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">4. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties. We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <p><strong>4.1 Service Providers.</strong> We may share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, including cloud hosting (AWS), payment processing, analytics, and customer support. These providers are contractually obligated to use your data only as directed by us and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>4.2 Legal Requirements.</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or when we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>
    <p><strong>4.3 Business Transfers.</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via email or prominent notice within the App of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information.</p>
    <p><strong>4.4 Aggregated or De-identified Data.</strong> We may share aggregated or de-identified data that cannot reasonably be used to identify you for research, analysis, or business purposes.</p>
