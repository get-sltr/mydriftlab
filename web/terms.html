  <h1 class="page-title">Terms of Service</h1>
  <div class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 24, 2026</div>

  <p class="intro">Welcome to MyDriftLAB. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the MyDriftLAB mobile application (the "App" or "Service") operated by SLTR Digital LLC, a California limited liability company ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"). By downloading, installing, accessing, or using MyDriftLAB, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.</p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use MyDriftLAB. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18 (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction), you may only use the Service with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet these eligibility requirements.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">2. Account Registration</h2>
    <p>To access certain features of the Service, you must create an account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and to keep your account information updated. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at any time, with or without notice, for any reason, including but not limited to violation of these Terms.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">3. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>MyDriftLAB is a sleep wellness application that provides:</p>
    <p>(a) Sleep content including soundscapes, sleep stories, guided meditations, breathing exercises, and music designed to help users fall asleep;</p>
    <p>(b) Sleep environment monitoring using your device's built-in microphone, light sensor (Android only), accelerometer, and barometer to detect ambient noise levels, noise events, light changes, and movement during sleep;</p>
    <p>(c) Optional integration with Apple HealthKit to read health data from Apple Watch or other connected devices, including but not limited to heart rate, blood oxygen, sleep stages, respiratory rate, skin temperature, and heart rate variability;</p>
    <p>(d) Morning reports summarizing sleep environment events and, where available, correlating environment data with body metrics;</p>
    <p>(e) A Rest Score calculated from environment events and, where available, biometric data;</p>
    <p>(f) Trend analysis and pattern detection across multiple nights of data;</p>
    <p>(g) Sleep experiments ("Labs") allowing users to test environmental changes and measure their impact on sleep quality.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">4. Audio Recording and Monitoring</h2>
    <p><strong>4.1 On-Device Processing.</strong> MyDriftLAB uses your device's microphone to measure ambient noise levels (decibel readings) and detect noise events during sleep monitoring sessions. All audio processing occurs entirely on your device. Raw audio is never recorded, stored, transmitted, or uploaded to any server. The App extracts only numeric data (timestamps, decibel levels, duration, and event classification) from the audio stream.</p>
    <p><strong>4.2 No Audio Storage.</strong> MyDriftLAB does not retain, save, or have access to any audio recordings. A temporary audio file may be created by the operating system during monitoring, but it is neither read nor referenced by the App. Only numeric metadata derived from audio metering is used and stored.</p>
    <p><strong>4.3 Microphone Permission.</strong> You must grant microphone permission to use the sleep monitoring feature. You may revoke this permission at any time through your device settings, which will disable the monitoring functionality.</p>
    <p><strong>4.4 Consent.</strong> By activating the sleep monitoring feature, you expressly consent to the use of your device's microphone for the sole purpose of ambient noise level measurement and event detection as described in these Terms and our Privacy Policy.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">5. Apple HealthKit Integration</h2>
    <p><strong>5.1 Optional Feature.</strong> MyDriftLAB offers optional integration with Apple HealthKit. This feature is not required to use the App. If you choose to enable HealthKit integration, MyDriftLAB will request read-only access to specific health data types stored in Apple Health on your device.</p>
    <p><strong>5.2 Data Types.</strong> Health data types MyDriftLAB may request access to include, but are not limited to: heart rate, heart rate variability, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), skin temperature, respiratory rate, sleep analysis (sleep stages), and wrist motion data. As Apple introduces new health data types, MyDriftLAB may request access to additional data types through app updates, subject to your explicit approval.</p>
    <p><strong>5.3 No Advertising Use.</strong> Health data obtained through HealthKit is never used for advertising, marketing, or data mining purposes. This data is used solely to provide you with personalized sleep insights and environment-to-body correlation analysis within the App.</p>
    <p><strong>5.4 User Control.</strong> You maintain full control over which health data types MyDriftLAB can access. You may grant or revoke permissions for individual data types at any time through your device's Health settings (Settings > Health > Data Access & Devices).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">6. Estimated Data and Accuracy</h2>
    <p><strong>6.1 Estimated Measurements.</strong> Certain environmental measurements displayed in the App, including but not limited to temperature and humidity readings, are estimates derived from device sensors (barometer), user-provided settings (thermostat), or external data sources (local weather APIs). These estimates may not accurately reflect actual room conditions.</p>
    <p><strong>6.2 Estimated Data Labeling.</strong> All estimated data is clearly labeled as "Estimated" within the App. Users should not rely on estimated data for medical, health, or safety decisions.</p>
    <p><strong>6.3 Not a Medical Device.</strong> MyDriftLAB is not a medical device and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition. The App does not provide medical advice. The Rest Score, sleep reports, insights, and recommendations are for informational and wellness purposes only. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional regarding any health concerns, sleep disorders, or medical conditions.</p>
    <p><strong>6.4 Noise Classification Limitations.</strong> In its current version, MyDriftLAB uses rule-based detection to identify noise events by decibel level, duration, and pattern. The App does not identify specific noise sources (e.g., distinguishing between a dog barking and traffic). Noise event classifications are approximate and should be interpreted accordingly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">7. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p><strong>7.1 Free and Premium Tiers.</strong> MyDriftLAB offers both a free tier with limited functionality and a premium subscription ("Pro") with expanded features. Current pricing is $4.99 per month. Pricing is subject to change with reasonable advance notice.</p>
    <p><strong>7.2 Automatic Renewal.</strong> Pro subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless canceled at least 24 hours before the renewal date. You may cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple App Store or Google Play Store account settings.</p>
    <p><strong>7.3 Refunds.</strong> Refunds are handled in accordance with the applicable app store policies (Apple App Store or Google Play Store). We do not process refunds directly.</p>
    <p><strong>7.4 Price Changes.</strong> We reserve the right to change subscription pricing. Any price changes will take effect at the start of the next billing cycle following notice of the change.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">8. User Content and Conduct</h2>
